## Pancakes

This is a demo project to show you how React.js works.

## Set up

Pull down this repo, then run `npm install` - this should put React and all the other things on your machine

## Run the demo

Simply type `npm start` and the demo project should open in your web browser

## Part one

For part one, we aren't going to look at the code, just play with the tool

## Part two

For part two, we are going to play with some components inside the code.
You will need to open the file `index.js`
Uncomment the line
`//ReactDOM.render(<StackOfPancakes />, document.getElementById('root'));`
and comment out the line
`ReactDOM.render(<DynamicStackOfPancakes />,document.getElementById('root'));`

You might need to restart the project once you've changed this
